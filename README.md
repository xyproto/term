## Deprecated

Please consider using these Go packages instead, which should cover the same functionality:

* [vt100](https://github.com/xyproto/vt100) for coloring text, reading keys or drawing terminal "graphics".
* [textoutput](https://github.com/xyproto/textoutput) for coloring text, with tags like `<blue>`.
* [readline](https://github.com/chzyer/readline) for a pure-Go implementation of similar functionality to the C `readline` library.
